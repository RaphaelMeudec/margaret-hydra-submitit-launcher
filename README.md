![GitHub Workflow Build Status](https://github.com/zaccharieramzi/jz-hydra-submitit-launcher/workflows/Continuous%20testing/badge.svg)

A Jean Zay tailored Hydra submitit launcher based on [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) and its [submitit-launcher plugin](https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/submitit_launcher/).
Basically it extends the submitit-launcher plugin with defaults that make sense for Jean Zay.
